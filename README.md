A lightweight WordPress plugin that restricts **Contact Form 7** submissions to only allow organization (corporate) email addresses. It dynamically validates the email field both on the server and client side, blocking common personal email domains like `gmail.com`, `yahoo.com`, `hotmail.com`, etc.
